# Hackfodder-os #

Hackfodder-os was originally created with low level programmers in mind, it is an operating system (so far version 1.1 has one kernel module) that was designed to eliminate errors found when C programmers do not fully understand the compilers they use or the concept of compiling.

With that out of the way It's time for me to tell you what we actually do here at hackfodder. This site has been designed with the intention of letting non-technical business types know of the dangers and threats of faulty software and poorly installed electrical equipment and the steps you must take to ensure that the risk of losing data and more importantly losing money are kept to a minimum. There will be frequent blog posts detailing what in my opinion is the latest and most prevalent security issues, there will also be a monthly EZine for all members to subscribe to, educational tasks for those who wish to secure there networks/systems themselves and login section for customers to get technical support from our highly trained security processionals.
